# CodeIgniter 3 CRUD using Ajax 

This is capstone project of offline bootcamp held by eCentrix Academy that I attended. The main goal for this project is :

1. Shows data from database using jqGrid
2. CRUD features using Ajax
3. Export data in xlsx format
4. Search features

I also add some extra features like replacing dafault JavaScript alert using SweetAlert2, Form Validation for security reasons, User Validation, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone this project.
```
git clone https://github.com/hellohendri/data-karyawan.git
```
2. Import the database. I've exported the database at `modules/bootcamp03/ecentrix_bootcamp.sql`
3. Open your terminal then run
```
composer install
```

## Guides

First thing to notice is this project using HMVC file structures which contain many projects from the other candidates of bootcamp as well. You can find mine at `modules/bootcamp03`.

Then for opening my project you need to go to your browser then visit this link :
